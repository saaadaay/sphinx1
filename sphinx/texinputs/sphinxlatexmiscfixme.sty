%% COLOR (general)
%
% FIXME: \normalcolor should probably be used in place of \py@NormalColor
% elsewhere, and \py@NormalColor should never be defined. \normalcolor
% switches to the colour from last \color call in preamble.
\def\py@NormalColor{\color{black}}
% FIXME: it is probably better to use \color{TitleColor}, as TitleColor
% can be customized from 'sphinxsetup', and drop usage of \py@TitleColor
\def\py@TitleColor{\color{TitleColor}}
% FIXME: this line should be dropped, as "9" is default anyhow.
