   .. admonition:: üìù Rich Text Formatting
      :class: sphinx-feature

      Using reStructuredText_ or :ref:`MyST Markdown <markdown>`,
      Sphinx supports rich text formatting, including
      tables, highlighted code blocks, mathematical notations, and more.
      This enables the creation of
      highly detailed and structured technical documents.

   .. admonition:: üîó Powerful Cross-Referencing
      :class: sphinx-feature

      Sphinx excels in its ability to create :ref:`cross-references <xref-syntax>`
      within the documentation,
      and even across :ref:`different projects <ext-intersphinx>`,
      with automated index generation.
      This includes references to
      sections, figures, tables, citations, glossaries and code objects.

   .. admonition:: üìö Versatile Documentation Formats
      :class: sphinx-feature

      Sphinx can generate documentation in various formats
      including HTML, LaTeX (for PDF), ePub, Texinfo, and more.
      This versatility ensures that your documentation
      can be easily accessed and read in the preferred format of your audience.

   .. admonition:: üé® Extensive Theme Support
      :class: sphinx-feature

      With a wide range of :ref:`built-in <builtin-themes>`
      and :ref:`third-party <third-party-themes>` HTML themes
      and the ability to customize
      or :ref:`create new themes <extension-html-theme>`,
      Sphinx allows you to create visually appealing documentation
      that aligns with your branding and aesthetic preferences.

   .. admonition:: üîå Fully Extensible
      :class: sphinx-feature

      Sphinx has robust :ref:`extension mechanisms <extending-sphinx>`
      that allow you to add custom functionality for complex documentation needs.
      There are numerous :ref:`built-in <builtin-extensions>`
      and :ref:`third-party <third-party-extensions>`
      extensions available for tasks like
      creating diagrams, testing code, and more.

   .. admonition:: üõ†Ô∏è Automatic API Documentation
      :class: sphinx-feature

      For Python, C++ and other software projects, Sphinx can automatically
      :ref:`generate API documentation <ext-autodoc>` from docstrings.
      This ensures that your code documentation
      stays up-to-date with minimal manual effort.

   .. admonition:: üåç Internationalization (i18n)
      :class: sphinx-feature

      Sphinx supports :ref:`internationalization <intl>`,
      allowing you to create documentation in multiple languages.
      This is particularly beneficial for projects with a global audience.

   .. admonition:: üåü Active Community and Support
      :class: sphinx-feature

      Sphinx has an :ref:`active community <support-index>`
      and extensive documentation itself.
      There are numerous resources, including tutorials, forums, and examples,
      which can help users get the most out of the tool.

   .. .. admonition:: üåê Integration with Version Control
   ..    :class: sphinx-feature

   ..    Sphinx integrates seamlessly with version control systems like Git.
   ..    This allows for easy collaboration, version tracking,
   ..    and deployment of documentation as part of a continuous integration pipeline.
