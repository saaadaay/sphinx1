:mod:`sphinx.ext.apidoc` -- Generate autodoc stub pages
=======================================================

.. module:: sphinx.ext.apidoc
   :synopsis: Generate autodoc stub pages

.. versionadded:: 1.8

   The functionality of this extension was previously available as part of the
   :program:`sphinx-apidoc` tool. This ability to run this automatically by way
   of a Sphinx extension was added in 1.8.

This extension generates function, method and attribute stub documentation
pages, similar to that generated by API doc tools like Doxygen or Javadoc.

.. warning::

   The apidoc extension generates source files that use
   :mod:`sphinx.ext.autodoc` to document all found modules. If any modules
   have side effects on import, these will be executed when building
   documentation.

   If you document scripts (as opposed to library modules), make sure their
   main routine is protected by a ``if __name__ == '__main__'`` condition.

Configuration
-------------

The apidoc extension uses the following configuration values:

.. confval:: apidoc_module_dir

   The path to the module to document. This must be a path to a Python package.
   This path can be a path relative to the documentation source directory or an
   absolute path.

.. confval:: apidoc_output_dir

   The output directory. If it does not exist, it is created. This path is
   relative to the documentation source directory.

   Defaults to ``api``.

.. confval:: apidoc_excluded_modules

   An optional list of modules to exclude. These should be paths relative to
   ``api_module_dir``. fnmatch-style wildcarding is supported.

   Defaults to ``[]``.
